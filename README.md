Hi, Iâ€™m @Hevanafa

I'm interested in learning computer science & exploring algorithms.

Currently I'm learning Rust and would love to learn more about web dev stacks.

I work as a full-time frontend web developer in a multinational company.

I usually spend time in CodinGame when I'm free.

- Ruby (for file management)
- Lua
- Python 3

- Java MIDP (Java 1.4)
- DBMS: MySQL, Sqlite, Postgres
- C++

Only for hobby:

- Clojure

I have used these JavaScript frameworks to make projects in the company that I'm working:

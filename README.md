Hi, Iâ€™m @Hevanafa

I'm interested in learning computer science & exploring algorithms.

I work as a full-time frontend web developer in real life.

I usually spend time in CodinGame when I'm free.

# Personal Projects

## Number Sorter

This is the game that I hope can be finished any time soon.

## Tip Tap

This was a failed game project.

The reason is the lack of initiative.

## Aksara Jawa converter

## Thai Clock

## Bahasa Panda

## Scrabble Calculator

## Fancy To-Do List

## Random Minecraft Banner Generator (Prototype)

## Minecraft Enchantment Generator

## Succubus & Goblins

## e621 Downloader

## Danbooru Downloader

## YouTube & BiliBili Thumbnail Downloader

I made this with Perl.

## Indexed Bitmap Image Viewer in C

# Programming Languages

I'm confident in a few programming languages.

## Usual use at the office
- TypeScript
- Sass
- Ruby (occasionally)

## Confident Enough

I have some experience in the other programming languages as well:

- Rust (currently learning)
- C# (for prototyping & small desktop apps)
- JavaScript & TypeScript
- Perl (for text file processing & quick scripting)
- Ruby (for file management)
- Lua
- Python 3
- PHP
- DBMS: MySQL, Sqlite, Postgres

Only for hobby:

- C (Turbo C)
- VB .Net
- Java (from MIDP)
- Clojure

I have used these JavaScript frameworks to make projects in the company that I'm working:

- React.js (more than 4 years of experience)
- Socket IO
- Node.js
- Vue.js (only for a few months)
- Phaser 3
- Svelte

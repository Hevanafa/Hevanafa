Hi, Iâ€™m @Hevanafa

[![](https://visitcount.itsvg.in/api?id=Hevanafa&label=Page%20Views&color=7&icon=4&pretty=false)](https://visitcount.itsvg.in)

I'm interested in learning computer science & exploring algorithms.

Currently I'm learning Rust and would love to learn more about web dev stacks.

I work as a full-time frontend web developer in a multinational company.

I usually spend time in CodinGame when I'm free.

# Programming Languages

I'm confident in a few programming languages.

- Ruby (occasionally)

## Confident Enough

I have some experience in the other programming languages as well:

- Rust (currently learning)
- C# (for prototyping, games & desktop apps)
- JavaScript & TypeScript
- Perl (for text file processing & quick scripting)
- Ruby (for file management & prototyping)
- Lua (for Roblox)
- PHP
- Java & Kotlin for Minecraft modding (Java 10+)
- Java MIDP (Java 1.4)
- DBMS: MySQL, Sqlite, Postgres

Only for hobby:

- C++
- Python 3
- C (Turbo C)
- VB .Net
- Java (from MIDP)
- Clojure

I have used these JavaScript frameworks to make projects in the company that I'm working:

- React.js (more than 4 years of experience)
- Socket IO
- Node.js
- Vue.js (only for a few months)
- Phaser 3
- Svelte
